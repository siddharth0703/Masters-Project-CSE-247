This project aims to propose an architecture for classifying wound healing stages from a series of wound images. The classification of wound severity is a critical
step in wound diagnosis. An effective classifier can help medical professionals categorize wound conditions more quickly and affordably, allowing them to choose the best treatment option. This study uses wound images to train a neural network-based wound classifier that classifies the images into one of four stages in the
wound healing process. The dataset contains single wound images from different mice pictured daily till the wound maturates. Multi-Head attention is added using Vision Transformer to create a model which analyses the dataset. Attention maps of the images are analyzed to see where the model pays attention. The attention
maps of two models are compared . The first one has a pre-training task to detect temporal validity followed by wound stage classification. The second model is trained from scratch to classify images into wound stages.
